## Abstract
By the end of April 2020 global cases for COVID-19 had surged past 1,000,000 patients and with an increasing amount of countries slowing economic activity, major equity markets and traditional economic benchmark indicators were negatively impacted. To further understand this impact between daily COIVD-19 cases being reported from three major equity markets indices from USA’s S&P 500, India's S&P BSE Sensex, and Brazil's BVSP and the daily returns posted for those days we will cross analyze market data with new COVID-19 patient cases looking for correlations. Our team hypothesizes that a correlation will exist between negative daily returns when heightened COVID-19 cases are reported within the market’s respective countries.

# H₀: The number of daily new COVID-19 cases in USA, India, and Brazil has no effect on the daily returns for these countries’ respective major equity market indices.
# H₁: The number of daily new COVID-19 cases in USA, India, and Brazil has a negative effect on the daily returns for these countries’ respective major equity market indices.
