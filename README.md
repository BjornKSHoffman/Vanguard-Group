### Vanguard-Group
## Group Project #1

## Product
The goal of our project is to compare daily coronavirus cases and deaths in three geographical locations, and to compare them against daily primary market index returns in those geographic locations. We then will correlate the data to find any potential connection, and see if the data lends itself to conclusions that could be invaluable 

and highlight insights visually
